## Tronxy Crux 1 with Bltouch + Kingroon Titan Extruder
If you're using this on an unmodified Crux 1, you'll need to change:
- Extruder/hotend/thermistor settings
- Print area (this mod decreased print volume)
- Endstop locations and offsets
- BLtouch/CRtouch offsets

## Features:
- All original pins defined/working (no screen, though)
- KAMP installed & configured
- Beeper configured & working
  - tones copied from https://github.com/rootiest/zippy-klipper_config, timing seems off, though
- Mainsail & Fluidd (I'm indecisive like that)
- print start/end/pause/resume macros
